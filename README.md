**WoX** is a launcher for Windows that simply works. It's an alternative to [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/). You can call it Windows omni-eXecutor if you want a long name.

Build
-----

1. Install Visual Studio 2015 and tick all Windows 10 sdk options
2. Open powershell with admin permission and `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser`

3. Building with VS 2019:
    - Apparently last Windows 10 SDK which supported UwpDesktop is version 14393.
    (see *https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox/pull/1827#commitcomment-26475392* )
    - This is needed to compile "Programs" Plugin (UWP.cs)
    - If you use a later SDK version, you will see the "References" of Plugin.Programs as broken.
    - However this SDK cannot be intsalled via installer of VS 2019.
    - If you encounter problems building using VS 2019, then install above listed SDK using the installer of VS 2017.
    - After that you can build using VS 2019.
