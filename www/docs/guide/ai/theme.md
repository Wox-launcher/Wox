# Create Theme with AI

> Please note that this feature requires the configuration of AI settings to be used. If you have not configured AI settings, please refer to the [AI Settings](./settings.md) documentation.

Wox provides a unique feature that allows you to create themes using AI. This feature can be accessed using the `theme ai` command followed by your theme description. The AI will interpret your description and create a theme based on it.

## Usage

For example, if you want to create a theme with a macaroon color scheme, you can use the command:

```
theme ai macaroon color
```

The AI will then generate a theme that matches the macaroon color scheme.

This feature provides a quick and easy way to create unique and personalized themes for your Wox launcher. Enjoy the flexibility and creativity that comes with AI-powered theme creation.
