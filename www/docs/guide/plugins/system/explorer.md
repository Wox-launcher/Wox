# Explorer Plugin

Explorer helps you navigate folders in File Explorer/Finder and jump to folders in open/save dialogs.

## What it does

- When a file explorer is active, search entries in the current folder
- When an open/save dialog is active, show recommended folders
- Works on Windows and macOS

## Quick start

**In File Explorer / Finder**

```
Documents
Downloads
project
```

Select a folder to navigate. Use `Ctrl+Enter` to open the containing folder in a new window.

**In open/save dialogs**

Open Wox while the dialog is active to see recommended folders:
- Recently used folders for that app
- Open Finder windows
- Common system folders (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.)

## Notes

- Only shows results when File Explorer/Finder or an open/save dialog is active.
- No user-facing settings.
