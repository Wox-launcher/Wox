# Calculator Plugin

Calculator evaluates math expressions directly in Wox and keeps a small history.

## What it does

- Auto-detects expressions with operators
- Supports `+ - * / ^` and parentheses
- Shows thousands separators by default
- Stores recent calculations for reuse

## Quick start

```
100 + 200
2 ^ 10
(500 - 100) / (10 + 10)
```

## History

Use `calculator` to browse history. You can copy results or re-run a past expression.

## Notes

- An operator is required to trigger calculation (e.g., `123 + 1`).
- Copy actions include raw value and value with separators.
