# Action Panel

The Action Panel provides additional actions for a selected result. It allows you to do more than just the default action (which is usually opening the item).

## Accessing Action Panel

1. Select a result in the main query window.
2. Press `Alt + J` (or `Cmd + J` on macOS).

## Common Actions

The available actions depend on the type of result, but common ones include:

- **Open**: Open the file, application, or URL.
- **Copy Path**: Copy the file path to the clipboard.
- **Copy Value**: Copy the text value to the clipboard.
- **Open in File Explorer**: Reveal the file in the system file manager.
- **Run as Administrator**: Run the application with elevated privileges (Windows).

## Plugin Specific Actions

Plugins can define their own custom actions. For example, a package manager plugin might offer "Uninstall" or "Update" actions for a package result.
