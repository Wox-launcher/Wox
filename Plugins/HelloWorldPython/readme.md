### Make main executable or start file `Main.py`
Use pre-defined wox integrations by importing `Wox`
 - `from wox import Wox`
 - Make a `class` and pass `Wox` as an argument to it
 - Initiate the class in the following manner:
```
 if __name__ == "__main__":
    HelloWorld()
```
 - The app receives the keyStrokes in `query()` of `main.py`
 - The context-menu for the result can be programmed in `context_menu` of `main.py`
 - The results in drop-down can be assigned triggers by defining custom method in `JsonRPCAction` of `results`
